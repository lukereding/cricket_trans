### findings:

- females varied in their mating preferences
- most crikets are transitive
- just as there are variation in mating preferences, there is variation in transitivity among females
- the proportion of intransitive females was lower in one of the experiments compared with the other two experiments
- even among transitive females, females typically showed preferences, while having a consistent ordering, did not have a consistent strength of preference 



to note:

- females can find the same male attractive but still vary in transitivity pattern
